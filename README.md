# PythonProject
- Calculator
- This project serves as a simple calculation software for calculations have fun!
# Files listing:
- `main.py` contains the root and enabales all the necessary buttons to fill the calculator
- `ButonPack.py` contains all button creations spearated into functions that create specific "type" of buttons
- `ButtonListener.py` contains nearly all functions used by buttons from `ButtonPack.py`
- `MemoryManipulation.py` contains functions used by memory panel buttons
# Instructions:
- Press number from 0-9 and press a desired calculation: +, -, /, *; and then choose second number for the equation.
- Finally press " = " button to show the result.
- Starting from Top left corner:
- M+: this action adds the currently seen result in memory and is later shown on the left side corner.
- M-: on the other hands subtracts from the currently saved memory.
- MC: clears the current memory.
- MR: reads from the memory and puts it into the entry.
- C: cleans the current entry.
- <x: erases the entry digit by digit with each click.
- x²: raises the entry number to 2nd power.
- √: calculates a square root of the entry number.
- ⅟: calculates division of 1 by entry number.
- x!: calculates factorial of the entry number.
- %: makes a percentage number of entry number.
- ¬: this negates the entry number.
- .: adds a float point precision to the result.
- '/': division ; '*': muliplication ; '-': subtraction ; '+' addition ; '=': equal sign.
